# Advanced JavaScript Payment Form

## Overview
The Advanced JavaScript Payment Form is designed for students who need to obtain an access code for a notes website. Users must fill out the form with their details before proceeding with payment. The form captures necessary information like name, email, college, and class, and it requires users to complete it before allowing them to click the payment or submit button. The payment is processed through a scanner, and upon submission, the user is redirected to their email with a pre-filled message containing their details.

## Features
- **Form Validation**: 
  - Users cannot click the payment or submit button until all required fields are filled in.

- **Payment Scanner**: 
  - The form includes a scanner for users to scan their payment before submission.

- **Email Redirection**: 
  - After submitting the form, users are redirected to their email with a pre-filled message that includes their name, class, college, and email.

- **Screenshot Attachment**: 
  - Users are required to attach a screenshot of their payment in the email before final submission.
